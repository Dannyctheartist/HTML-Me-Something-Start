       <p>My Favorite National Parks</p>
      
   <h2>National Parks</h2>
   <p>Making a list of my favorite National Parks is no easy task. There are so many great parks, each with unique sites and trails. There are many more parks I'd love to visit one day and so this list can change.
      For me it comes down to the memories I made at these parks and the uniqueness of them, the hisorty behind them. For example would have ever guessed that the most popluar national park is The Great Smokey Mountains, with over 10 million
      visits each year! Or how about the fact that California has the most National Parks in the USA, with nine, unique National Parks, spread out the state. There are 63 National Parks total!

   <h3>Yosemite</h3>
   <p>Yosemite National Park holds a special place in my heart as the first national park I ever visited, marking the beginning of my journey into the wonders of America's natural landscapes. 
      Renowned for its breathtaking beauty, Yosemite is home to iconic landmarks such as Half Dome and El Capitan, both of which offer challenging climbs and unforgettable views.
      The park also boasts the majestic Yosemite Falls, one of the tallest waterfalls in North America. Each year, the spring melt transforms the falls into a spectacular torrent, a natural spectacle that draws visitors from around the globe. 
      My childhood memories of Yosemite, coupled with its diverse ecosystems and historical significance as the cornerstone of the national park idea, solidify its status as my favorite national park.</p>
   <h4>Grand Canyon</h4>
   <p>The Grand Canyon is my second favorite national park, partly because it is the first and only park that i visted with my grandparents. The sheer vastness and beauty of the canyon are awe-inspiring, especially when viewed at sunset. 
      As the sun dips below the horizon, the canyon's rugged landscape is transformed into a mesmerizing painting of colors, with golden, pink, and purple hues giving the Grand Canyon a firey glow. One interesting historical fact about 
      the Grand Canyon is that it was first given federal protection as a forest reserve in 1893 before becoming a national park in 1919, thanks to the efforts of conservationists like President Theodore Roosevelt, 
      who famously declared, "In the Grand Canyon, Arizona has a natural wonder which is in kind absolutely unparalleled throughout the rest of the world." Walking along the canyon's rim and witnessing its grandeur firsthand is an 
      experience that left a lasting impression on me, making it a truly unforgettable destination. The Grand Canyon's stunning views, rich history, and the cherished memories of exploring its trails with my grandparents make it a place I hold dear.</p>

      <h5>El Yunque National Forest</h5>
   <p>El Yunque National Park, located in Puerto Rico, is my third favorite national park, and visiting it during the rainy season made the experience even more unforgettable. This rainforest is the only tropical rainforest in the United States 
      National Forest System, and its lush, green landscape is full of unique wildlife and plant species. During my visit, the frequent rains enhanced the beauty of the forest, creating a symphony of sounds as raindrops mixed with the calls 
      of native animals. Some of the unique animals found in El Yunque include the Puerto Rican parrot, an endangered species with its bright green feathers, and the coquí frog, whose distinctive call is a symbol of Puerto Rican culture. 
      The park is also home to over 240 species of trees and countless orchids and ferns. Exploring El Yunque's trails amidst the tall trees and flowing waterfalls was a breathtaking experience, making it a place of amazing natural 
      beauty and rich biodiversity.</p>
